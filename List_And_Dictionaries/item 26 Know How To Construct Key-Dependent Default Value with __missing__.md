setdefault method makes your code shorter while handling missing keys in some circumstances
but defaultdict can be used in many situations which is from the collection module
but there are times when both of this method becomes useless
``` 


```python
pictures = {}  # Initialize an empty dictionary to hold file handles
path = 'logotodo.png'  # Path to the image file

# Try to retrieve the file handle from the dictionary
if (handle := pictures.get(path)) is None:
    # If the handle is not in the dictionary, try to open the file
    try:
        handle = open(path, 'a+b')  # Open file in append and binary mode
    except OSError:
        print(f'Failed to open path {path}')  # Print error message if the file cannot be opened
        raise  # Re-raise the exception
    else:
        pictures[path] = handle  # Store the file handle in the dictionary

# Move the file pointer to the beginning of the file
handle.seek(0)

# Read the file's contents into image_data
image_data = handle.read()
```
about missing
```text
The __missing__ method in Python is used in custom dictionary subclasses to define behavior
for missing keys. When a key is not found in the dictionary, the __missing__ method is called
to handle the situation.
```

how to use missing to achieve the same functionality
```text
Define a custom dictionary class:
Create a subclass of dict that overrides the __missing__ method.

Implement the __missing__ method:
In this method, attempt to open the file, handle any errors, and store the file handle in the dictionary.
```
```python
class PictureDict(dict):
    def __missing__(self, key):
        try:
            handle = open(key, 'a+b')
        except OSError:
            print(f'Failed to open path {key}')
            raise
        else:
            self[key] = handle
            return handle

pictures = PictureDict()
path = 'logotodo.png'

handle = pictures[path]  # This will call __missing__ if the key is not present

handle.seek(0)
image_data = handle.read()
```

Explaination


```text
Custom Dictionary Class:

PictureDict is a subclass of dict with an overridden __missing__ method.

missing Method:
The __missing__ method attempts to open the file specified by the key (which is the path).
If the file cannot be opened (an OSError is raised), it prints an error message and re-raises the exception.
If the file is successfully opened, its handle is stored in the dictionary and returned.

Usage:
When handle = pictures[path] is executed, it attempts to retrieve the file handle from the pictures dictionary.
If the path key is not found, the __missing__ method is automatically called to handle the situation, opening the file and storing its handle in the dictionary.
The file pointer is then moved to the beginning of the file using handle.seek(0).
The file's contents are read into image_data.
This approach encapsulates the file-opening logic within the dictionary subclass, making the main code cleaner and more intuitive.
```
